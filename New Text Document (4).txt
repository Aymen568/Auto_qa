- QA metrics: (given only the frontend part)

	qualitative: functional, reliable, usable, and performs well under various conditions
	1- Functional Correctness: 
		Ensures all features, buttons, forms, and links work as intended. Broken functionality directly impacts user experience.
	1. Functional Correctness (Still Critical)

    What you can test:

        Links, buttons, and navigation.

        Form submissions (if forms are present).

        Interactive elements (e.g., dropdowns, sliders).

        Error handling for user inputs.

    How to measure:

        Manual testing by interacting with the page.

        Automated testing tools like Selenium or Cypress (if you can script tests for the URL).

2. Performance Under Load (Limited but Possible)

    What you can test:

        Frontend performance (e.g., page load time, resource loading).

        API response times (if the page makes visible API calls).

    What you can’t test:

        Database performance or server-side bottlenecks.

    How to measure:

        Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse, or GTmetrix to analyze frontend performance.

        Use k6 or JMeter to simulate user load on the frontend (if allowed by the website’s terms of service).

3. Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Compatibility (Still High Importance)

    What you can test:

        Layout and functionality across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

        Responsiveness on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

    How to measure:

        Use tools like BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, or Responsive Design Checker.

4. Accessibility Compliance (Still High Importance)

    What you can test:

        Keyboard navigation.

        Screen reader compatibility (if you have access to a screen reader).

        Color contrast and font readability.

        Alt text for images.

    How to measure:

        Use tools like WAVE, axe, or Lighthouse to evaluate accessibility.

5. Security (Limited but Possible)

    What you can test:

        Basic frontend vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS if input fields are present).

        SSL/TLS implementation (check for HTTPS and certificate validity).

        Mixed content issues (HTTP resources on an HTTPS page).

    What you can’t test:

        SQL injection or backend vulnerabilities (no database access).

    How to measure:

        Use tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to scan for frontend vulnerabilities.

        Check SSL/TLS with tools like SSL Labs.

Adjusted Metrics for URL-Only Testing

If you only have the webpage URL, here’s a revised list of 5 key metrics you can measure:

    Functional Correctness: Test all visible features and interactions.

    Frontend Performance: Measure page load time, resource loading, and responsiveness.

    Cross-Browser/Device Compatibility: Verify the page works across browsers and devices.

    Accessibility Compliance: Ensure the page meets accessibility standards.

    Basic Security: Check for HTTPS, mixed content, and frontend vulnerabilities.

Tools for URL-Only Testing

    Functional Testing: Selenium, Cypress, Playwright.

    Performance Testing: Google PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse, GTmetrix.

    Cross-Browser Testing: BrowserStack, Sauce Labs.

    Accessibility Testing: WAVE, axe, Lighthouse.

    Security Testing: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, SSL Labs.
